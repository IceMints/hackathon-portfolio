First week of the fellowship, our pod randomly split us into teams of 3 to <br>
build a portfolio project. Github was very useful in supporting team development.<br>
It was a fun experience and I learned a lot from it. <br>
<br>
Topics learned:<br>

- Created my first hackathon project with a team
- html/css that I didn't know before
- Flask to build a portfolio-blog
- Github usage in a team environment
