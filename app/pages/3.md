title: 3. Database and Services
date: 2021-06-26
category: general


I learned to move the portfolio-blog into a service. With a service, the website <br>
will restart when the server restarts without having to manually start it in <br>
a tmux background. After switching website to a service, a database is added <br>
along with a respective login and registeration page. Then we built a bash script<br>
to check our website endpoints. <br>
