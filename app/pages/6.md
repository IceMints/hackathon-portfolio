This week I fell a little behind in completing my trainuals. There is a lot<br>
of information in this week's chapters regarding monitoring and netowrking.<br>
I was introduced to a lot of command line tools that dealt with monitoring<br>
different parts of the system. Some are pre packaged with the distribution<br>
and it comes in handy for analyzing the system to see what programs are<br>
using most of its resources. The most amusing thing I learn is the out of <br>
memory killer (oom). Apparently when it was first introduced it can wipe<br>
someone's locked screen, so people can have free access to the system<br>
once the system ran out of memory and unlocks the screen for you. This<br>
has been fixed, of course, and now follows a system where the latest<br>
loaded program that is eating the most memory is usually the first one to <br>
be killed by the oom killer. <br>
