category: general

I containerized the different parts of my website using Docker and YAML.<br>
I played with some docker images and there is a lot of pre-created images<br>
from hub.docker.com. I've also attended a Machine Learning presentation by <br>
google that talked about the applications of Tensorflow-js for object <br>
recognition and augmented reality. <br>

Topics learned:<br>

- Containers
- YAML
- Docker
