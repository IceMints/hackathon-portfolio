Week 8 was pretty fun. The trainual reading was a quick review on linux <br>
filesystems, and monitoring. User, Group and World permissions were introduced.<br>
I got to troubleshoot an AWS instance and a sample portfolio web app<br>
in a docker container. Both were fun! I do not know if it was late at night<br>
but the volume error took longer than it should, overall it was a fun<br>
experience. <br>
