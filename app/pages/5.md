This week we learned about CI/CD. I've never heard of it or used it before<br>
but now I have a little experience deploying my website using CI/CD. <br>
The process of CI/CD is done with GitHub Actions. It was very interesting<br>
pushing my first lint.yml, I believed it broke my database so I had to <br>
reset my code. Lint is an amazing tool but my repository have 2 errors<br>
stating my migration folder have lines that are too long and I'm still<br>
investigating on how to solve it. On the other hand, I did manage to<br>
adjust nginx to decline anything that isn't https. <br>
